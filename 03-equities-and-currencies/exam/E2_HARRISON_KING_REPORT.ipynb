This means that unlike vanilla options with a dimensionality of two (two independent variables, $S$ and $t$) the Asian option is a three-dimensional problem and the differential equation has three independent variables, the underlying asset price, $S$, the time, $t$, and the average price of the underlying asset over the life of the option, $A(0, T)$.\n",

    "**Arithmetic and Geometric Asian Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "The average price, $A(0, T)$, can be computed in several ways, the most common being the arithmetic and geometric average. The arithmetic average is the sum of the asset prices, equally weighted, divided by the total number of prices used. The geometric average on the other hand is the exponential of the sum of all the logarithms of the constituent prices, equally weighted, divided by the total number of price used. Continuously sampled geometric Asian options are easy to price as there is a closed form analytical solution using the Black-Scholes formula. This is because the geometric average of a lognormally distributed underlying asset has a lognormal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, arithmetic Asian options are difficult to price as the arithmetic average of a lognormally distributed underlying asset does not have a lognormal distribution. This means that we cannot use the Black-Scholes formula to price the option and instead we must use a Monte Carlo approach for pricing. As the Monte Carlo scheme of pricing exotic options is the focus of this report, we will focus on arithmetic Asian options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discrete and Continuous Sampled Averages**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data could be continously sampled or sampled at discrete times to calculate averages. With the former, using every realised price over a finite time period, the sums calculated in the average become integrals of the asset price over the averaging period. This gives a continuously sampled average. With the latter and more common sampling approach, the averaging period is divided into $N$ discrete time intervals beginning at time $t = 0$ and ending at maturity, $T$. The average is calculated using the asset price at the end of each interval (for example, using the closing price of the asset at the end of each day). This gives a discretely sampled average. The discretely sampled average is more common outside of theoretical contexts as it is more practical and more realistic. This will be the main approach taken in this report.\n",

    "Much like Asian options, the path dependent variable ($M(0, T)$) can be calculated with continous or discrete sampling. Focussing just on the maximum lookback option with the former, using every realised price over a finite time period, the maximum price becomes the maximum of the asset price over the prescribed period giving a continously sampled maximum. With this sampling methodology the realised asset price is always less than or equal to the maximum. This theoretical approach allows for a closed form analytical solution using the Black-Scholes formula, however as with Asian options continous monitoring is less practical than discrete. \n",

    "The discretly sampled approach of dividing the prescribed period into $N$ discrete time intervals beginning at time $t = 0$ and ending at maturity, $T$ is commonly used in practise. The discretly sampled maximum is calculated using the asset price at the end of each interval (for example, using the closing price of the asset at the end of each day). With this methodology, the asset price can exceed the maximum, $M(0, T)$. Additionally, the maximum is much less frequently increased across the prescribed period, therefore as well as being more practical than continous sampling, the discretly sampled maximum results in a lower option price and is used to decrease the value of a contract.
